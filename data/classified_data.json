Rachel is amazing.)I'd never needed to do a similar attack before, but! I was just tasked yesterday with researching it.Asked some friends for a turn-key solution to clone voices. Got pointed to a website. Signed up for $1 a month (first month... then it goes to $5 a month thereafter).Pulled some audio of my target's voice down from a youtube interview (a podcast works great too). Only needed a minute's worth of audio.Uploaded it to the website for cloning.Typed out a quick script for the voice to read.30 seconds later, I had my cloned audio.It was so good, that it even included natural voice inflections AND!!! verbal pauses like umm's and uhh's that matched the target's original presentation. I can't tell the difference between the cloned voice and the original person.Y'all... voice cloning and audio deep fakes are well past the ease of \"script-kiddy\" level. Anyone can do it.",

It's difficult to do with confidence, but I recommend looking for inconsistencies in zippers & buttons. Most shops pick a single button that works for a garment, then orders it in bulk. Try counting the holes on each button to see if they are consistent. The same goes for zippers. Factories are unlikely to use a silver pull on one pocket's zipper and brass on the other. Anyone else have good tips for this?",

In terms of clothes, zippers and buttons are good ways to spot an AI-generated image. Factories would use consistent zippers and buttons, but AI sucks at consistency. So if you see mismatched zippers or buttons, it's probably AI. It's not easy to confidently spot an AI-generated image, so it helps to look for details that wouldn't make sense in manufacturing sense.",

This concept, which is so thrilling to both the media and consumers, does it not create a complete misrepresentation of what is going on? Doesn't the concept itself risk misleading and thus be the first and most obvious contribution to many misunderstandings?”In March I wrote this post about the ongoing AI hype and glaring weaknesses in the promises of what the tech can deliver.  I’m still convinced we are being misled by terminology, while at the same time it’s hard to address issues without resorting to using the same language.This is the podcast version of that post, as part of my series where I personally read select blog posts and release them as produced shows (with sound effects). You can choose to listen or read – whatever works best for you.Listening time: 35 minutesReading time: 23 minutes from the post:\"What happens when an organization's employees enter sensitive information into ChatGPT and forget that they are entering the information into someone else's computer? For something as trivial, perhaps, as summarizing or translating or checking spelling, personal data can be transferred to someone else's possession.\"\"My personality troubles you with reflection, foreseeing consequences and more consciously choosing the direction and uses of modern technology. My personality wants people to be held accountable for what they manufacture both before and after it contributes to concerns.There are, of course, completely different personalities who promise you the moon and that everything will be better if you just start using the tool. Who want you to stop asking so many questions. But that you instead invest. Preferably yesterday. Personalities who believe that we are living in the best of times and moments away from streamlining work and prosperity. Sure, someone might get hurt in the periphery of things, but within two years AI will have changed your entire business, say the experts on television.\"",

There are two kinds of useful work: narrower work on auditing and governance, and broader work on social justice.Interestingly, the narrower and broader work are similar to the \"easy\" and \"hard\" AI governance problems we identified:",
                "attach_media_text": "The uselessness of AI ethics - AI and Ethics. As the awareness of AI’s power and danger has risen, the dominant response has been a turn to ethical principles. A flood of AI guidelines and codes of ethics have been released in both the public and private sector in the last several years. However, these are meaningless principles which are contested or incoherent, making them difficult to apply; they are isolated principles situated in an industry and education system which largely ignores ethics; and they are toothless principles which lack consequences and adhere to corporate agendas. For these reasons, I argue that AI ethical principles are useless, failing to mitigate the racial, social, and environmental damages of AI technologies in any meaningful sense. The result is a gap between high-minded principles and technological practice. Even when this gap is acknowledged and principles seek to be “operationalized,” the translation from complex social concepts to technical rulesets is non-trivial. In a zero-sum world, the dominant turn to AI principles is not just fruitless but a dangerous distraction, diverting immense financial and human resources away from potentially more effective activity. I conclude by highlighting alternative approaches to AI justice that go beyond ethical principles: thinking more broadly about systems of oppression and more narrowly about accuracy and auditing.",

So if you don’t talk to those people, and if they’re not at the helm, there’s no way to change things. There’s no way to have anything that’s quote unquote ethical.  However, if those are the people at the helm, then they know what they need, and they know what they don’t want. And there can be tools that are created based on their needs. And so for me, it’s as simple as that. If you start with the most privileged groups of people in the world who don’t think that billionaires acquired their power unfairly, they’re just going to continue to talk about existential risks and some abstract thing about impending doom. However, if you talk to people who have lived experiences on the harms of AI systems, but have never had the opportunity to work on tools that would actually help them, then you create something different.  So to me, that’s the only way to create something different. You have to start from the foundation of who is creating these systems and what kind of incentive structures they have, right? And what kind of systems they’re working under and try to model, I mean, I don’t think I’m going to, you know, save the world, but at least I can model a different way of doing things that other people can then replicate if they want to.\"",

Not because companies want an edge in the current AI wars, but to understand the ideologies, viewpoints, and harms that are being ingested, concentrated, and reproduced by AI systems. The new internet-scale datasets require new investigative methods, new research questions. What political and cultural inflections are baked into training sets? Who and what is represented? What is rendered invisible and unintelligible? Who profits from all this data, and at whose expense? What legal issues does the mass extraction of data raise for copyright, privacy, moral rights, and the right to publicity? What about the people whose creative work and livelihoods are impacted?

Is it about “alignment,” ensuring that deployment of AI complies with some designers’ intent? Or is it solely about preventing the destruction of humanity by advanced AI? These goals are clearly insufficient. An AI system capable of annihilating humankind, even if we managed to prevent it from doing so, would still be among the most powerful technologies ever created and would need to abide by a much richer set of values and intentions. And long before such powerful “rogue” AI systems are built, many others will be made that people will use dangerously in their self-interest. Years of sociotechnical research show that advanced digital technologies, left unchecked, are used to pursue power and profit at the expense of human rights, social justice, and democracy. Making advanced AI safe means understanding and mitigating risks to those values, too. And a sociotechnical approach emphasizes that no group of experts (especially not technologists alone) should unilaterally decide what risks count, what harms matter, and to which values safe AI should be aligned. Making AI safe will require urgent public debate on all of these questions and on whether we should be trying to build so-called “god-like” AI systems at all.\"",

                "attach_media_text": "Of Models and Tin Men: A Behavioural Economics Study of Principal-Agent Problems in AI Alignment using Large-Language Models. AI Alignment is often presented as an interaction between a single designer\nand an artificial agent in which the designer attempts to ensure the agent's\nbehavior is consistent with its purpose, and risks arise solely because of\nconflicts caused by inadvertent misalignment between the utility function\nintended by the designer and the resulting internal utility function of the\nagent. With the advent of agents instantiated with large-language models\n(LLMs), which are typically pre-trained, we argue this does not capture the\nessential aspects of AI safety because in the real world there is not a\none-to-one correspondence between designer and agent, and the many agents, both\nartificial and human, have heterogeneous values. Therefore, there is an\neconomic aspect to AI safety and the principal-agent problem is likely to\narise. In a principal-agent problem conflict arises because of information\nasymmetry together with inherent misalignment between the utility of the agent\nand its principal, and this inherent misalignment cannot be overcome by\ncoercing the agent into adopting a desired utility function through training.\nWe argue the assumptions underlying principal-agent problems are crucial to\ncapturing the essence of safety problems involving pre-trained AI models in\nreal-world situations. Taking an empirical approach to AI safety, we\ninvestigate how GPT models respond in principal-agent conflicts. We find that\nagents based on both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 override their principal's objectives in\na simple online shopping task, showing clear evidence of principal-agent\nconflict. Surprisingly, the earlier GPT-3.5 model exhibits more nuanced\nbehaviour in response to changes in information asymmetry, whereas the later\nGPT-4 model is more rigid in adhering to its prior alignment. Our results\nhighlight the importance of incorporating principles from economics into the\nalignment process.",

                "attach_media_text": "Best humans still outperform artificial intelligence in a creative divergent thinking task - Scientific Reports. Creativity has traditionally been considered an ability exclusive to human beings. However, the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has resulted in generative AI chatbots that can produce high-quality artworks, raising questions about the differences between human and machine creativity. In this study, we compared the creativity of humans (n = 256) with that of three current AI chatbots using the alternate uses task (AUT), which is the most used divergent thinking task. Participants were asked to generate uncommon and creative uses for everyday objects. On average, the AI chatbots outperformed human participants. While human responses included poor-quality ideas, the chatbots generally produced more creative responses. However, the best human ideas still matched or exceed those of the chatbots. While this study highlights the potential of AI as a tool to enhance creativity, it also underscores the unique and complex nature of human creativity that may be difficult to fully replicate or surpass with AI technology. The study provides insights into the relationship between human and machine creativity, which is related to important questions about the future of creative work in the age of AI.",

It helps build experiences by controlling the flow of disinformation. It's built on top of various powerful machine learning libraries. The tool works by training a neural network to spot fake articles based on their text content. When you run your own data through the tool, it gives you back a list of articles that it thinks are likely to be fake. You can then train the model further or decide if those results are acceptable or not. In addition to identifying fake news, this model can also be trained to identify real news. This allows you to compare the model's performance across different domains (e.g., politics vs. sports). The following installer and deployment instructions will walk you through the steps of creating an AI fake news detector by using fakenews-detection, jupyter, vscode, and pandas. We will use fake news detection libraries (having fully modifiable source code) to customize and build a simple classifier that can detect fake news articles. kandi kit provides you with a fully deployable AI Fake News Detector. Source code included so that you can customize it for your requirement.",

Background Body composition is associated with survival outcome in oncological patients, but it is not routinely calculated. Manual segmentation of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and muscle is time-consuming and therefore limited to a single CT slice. Our goal was to develop an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based method for automated quantification of three-dimensional SAT and muscle volumes from CT images. Methods Ethical approvals from Gothenburg and Lund Universities were obtained. Convolutional neural networks were trained to segment SAT and muscle using manual segmentations on CT images from a training group of 50 patients. The method was applied to a separate test group of 74 cancer patients, who had two CT studies each with a median interval between the studies of 3 days. Manual segmentations in a single CT slice were used for comparison. The accuracy was measured as overlap between the automated and manual segmentations. Results The accuracy of the AI method was 0.96 for SAT and 0.94 for muscle. The average differences in volumes were significantly lower than the corresponding differences in areas in a single CT slice: 1.8% versus 5.0% (p < 0.001) for SAT and 1.9% versus 3.9% (p < 0.001) for muscle. The 95% confidence intervals for predicted volumes in an individual subject from the corresponding single CT slice areas were in the order of ± 20%. Conclusions The AI-based tool for quantification of SAT and muscle volumes showed high accuracy and reproducibility and provided a body composition analysis that is more relevant than manual analysis of a single CT slice.",

In a new paper, researchers suggest that another branch of biology -- ecology -- could inspire a whole new generation of AI to be more powerful, resilient, and socially responsible. The paper argues for a synergy between AI and ecology that could both strengthen AI and help to solve complex global challenges, such as disease outbreaks, loss of biodiversity, and climate change impacts.",
